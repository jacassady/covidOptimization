      "As of March 2020, the World Health Organization declared a mysterious Wuhan epidemic to be an international pandemic. Borders have closed, travel is limited, and most of the public in America has been given a “stay-at-home” order at least once. Many citizens feel that life as they know it is forever changed. The virus, known as Coronavirus or Covid-19, can cause fever, coughing, sore throat, shortness of breath, severe fatigue, and a plethora of other symptoms. Those at highest risk tend to be immunocompromised, such as individuals with diabetes, asthma, liver disease, and more.\n",

A multiperiod planning linear program with an objective of minimizing cost is used to display the constants, variables, etc. necessary for the overall problem, along with the levels of severity a patient can have, which has been simplified to four levels: no Coronavirus symptoms/symptoms not requiring hospitalization, mild symptoms that require fluids and monitoring the patient in the hospital, moderate symptoms that require more attention and a ventilator, and severe symptoms that require a ventilator and has additional life-threatening complications.
